{: data-content=" Who I am "}

Hi there! They call me Richard Gregory. I am an Outreachy intern. I will be working with the Fedora documentation team to enable CI/CD for the Fedora documentation website.

I am a self-taught software developer interested in AI and Machine Learning. I have worked mostly with languages like `Python, JavaScript, SQL; and technologies like AWS, Kubernetes, Docker, Openshift, Linux, Vagrant.` In my spare time, I enjoy running, reading & writing, travelling, listening to music (electronic, alternative-\*, indie pop) and contributing to open-source software. ~~Enough~~ More about me.

{: data-content=" Values "}
While I do have a lot of values. I will be going through three relevant ones:
- Authenticity

	I strive to be authentic in whatever I do and with whomever I am dealing with. Authenticity breeds trust between parties.

- Balance

	I strive to maintain a healthy work-life balance. A healthy balance between work and life prevents burnout and increases personal wellbeing. Having the right balance provides me room and motivation to continue developing myself.

- Community

	No one is an island. For one to reach their full potential they need a community of like and diverse minded people to do so.
	Communities contain a diversity of opinion, ideas, and knowledge that one would never encounter alone.

{: data-content=" My motivation to apply "}
What motivated me to apply to Outreachy is the opportunity to be part of a community of like-minded individuals. A place where I can express my talents. To have a strong mentor who is willing to guide me and give me the benefit of their experience. To learn from the wisdom of my peers and form connections.

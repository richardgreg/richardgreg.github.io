Hallo! Iâ€™m Richard Gregory.

I am a self-taught software developer interested in becoming an AI and Machine Learning engineer.

I have worked mostly with languages like `Python, JavaScript, SQL; and technologies like AWS, Kubernetes, Docker, Openshift, Linux, Vagrant.`

In my spare time, I enjoy running, reading & writing, travelling, listening to music (electronic, alternative-*, indie pop) and contributing to open-source software.
